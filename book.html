<h2>Introducing HTML5 Game Dev</h2>

<p>I recently wrote Introducing HTML5 Game Development: Developing Games with Impact for O’Reilly Media. The book is available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-HTML5-Development-Jesse-Freeman/dp/1449315178">here</a>. About the book:</p>
<img style="float:left; margin: 10px 16px 0 0;" src="/images/html5_book.png"/><p>Impact JS is a powerful and easy to pick up JavaScript game framework that can help you develop HTML5 games in very little time. Thanks to the adoption of HTML5 in modern desktop and mobile browsers, JavaScript is quickly becoming one of the easiest languages with which to develop games. Whether you want to deploy it to Web, desktop or mobile, Impact JS offers some great solutions for creating and distributing your game as well as the tools you will need to get started. In this book we cover some basic concepts of game development, how to manage your game’s asset pipeline, techniques for creating highly optimized game logic and some of the most commonly used HTML5 game development techniques out there. By the time you finish the book, you will have a solid foundation of ow to make a game with ImpactJS. While this book offers an overview to HTML5 game development with Impact JS, the knowledge contained in here is key to any aspiring HTML5 game developer.</p>

<p>Welcome, my name is Jesse Freeman and this is Game Cook. As a child I loved building video games. It all started when I got a Nintendo in 1985. Since then I have always built small experimental games in my free time. In 2001, I started Game Cook to host some of my Flash games and experiments. Now that I am moving into mobile game development I relaunched this site in the hope of creating a resource for the games I am building, the ones I have launched, and some of the interesting game dev work I am doing.</p>

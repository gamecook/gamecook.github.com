##MatchHack

>"MatchHack is based on the classic memory match game and uses RPG elements for a twist. The playerâ€™s goal is to explore the dungeon by clicking on tiles. Find matching tiles to beat the monster guarding the exit. Each match counts has a hit, each failed match counts as an attack from the monster. The game is over when the player is defeated."

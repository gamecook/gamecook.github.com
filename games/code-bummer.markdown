##Code Bummer

>"Code Bummer is the story of a homeless web developer who has been down on his luck since the web bubble pop of the late 90â€²s. Your goal is to help the CodeBum get new clients by navigating the treacherous streets of New York City. You start at the bottom of the level and must safely deliver CodeBum to the 5 clients at the top of the screen. Once you reach each of the 5 clients, the level restarts and gets harder."

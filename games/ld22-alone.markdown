##LD22-Alone

>"Alone was created during my first Ludum Dare copetition. The game is built around an Edgar Alan Poe poem and is devoid of any visuals except for the words themselves allowing the player to image the game's visuals in their own head. Creating a full game in 48 hour is a daunting task so this represent a sketch of a game I would like to expand upon in the future."

The text is a poem is by Edgar Alan Poe and the game is written in Impact JS. You will need a modern browser that supports HTML5/Canvas to run this game. As of now there is no mobile version, sorry.

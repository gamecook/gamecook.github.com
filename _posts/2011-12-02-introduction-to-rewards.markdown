title: Introduction To Rewards

One of the core systems of any game are rewards. Over the years games have evolved from having simple high scores tables to complex unlocking reward systems. In the casual gaming space rewarding players for continuing to play the game is a must. Let’s take a look at eight simple reward systems you can implement in your game:

*   **Level Selection** - Allowing users to pick the levels they want to play and unlocking now ones the more further they go in the game.

*   **Steps To Completion** - While playing through a game show the user how many steps are needed in order to complete the level or game. Showing progress helps players set their own goals and achieve them.

*   **Scores** - High Scores are one of the most basic reward systems around and should be in every game. Allowing the player to compete against others or even their own best scores helps increase replay value.

*   **Stats** - Players love statistics about what they have done in the game. Showing totals of how many monsters have been killed or how may times they died can also help encourage the player to work on increasing the important stats that matter to them.

*   **Badges** - Giving the player reminders of their greatest achievements is an excellent way of rewarding them and allowing them to have something to keep and collect as they play the game.

*   **Competition** - Playing against other players is an great way to challenge players and offer up a ever changing difficulty level that in game AI would never be able to batch.

*   **Ranking** - Along with scores and stats should be some kind of ranking. Let the player know how well they are doing and have that information shared among all of the people playing your game.

*   **In Game Currency** - Allow players to buy in game items that can help them clear a level or customize a character is not only a great reward for players but may also be an excellent way to make some additional money.

I’ll try to get to each of these on their own later on but it’s good to have a basic foundation on modern reward systems as you think about building out your own games.
